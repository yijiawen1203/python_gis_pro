i follow the Python Scripting for Geoprocessing Workflows in esri, and i complete the following task: 1) merge a table into a feature class and add the attribute table. 2) use buffer analysis to create a new layer of buffer. 3) find the description of the geoprocess tool and find the name of the geoprocess tool. 4) i use a for loop to create a list of buffer layers. 5) i merge the buffer layers into one single layer.
